maven-test-process-plugin
=========================

Welcome to the maven-test-process-plugin for [Apache Maven 2](http://maven.apache.org).

This plugin makes it easy to run integration tests as part of your Maven build which require starting up your application as a separate command. It was originally written to support containers who's start scripts are blocking in nature, therefore preventing use of more standard pre- and post- integration test phase tasks.

Features
--------

* One or more target processes (known as containers).
* One or more test processes.
* Supports targets which run in a blocking manner.
* Configurable target start timeout as well as overall timeout.
* Watches output of target processes to detect start completion and fatal errors.
* Watches output of test processes to detect test success/failure.
* Can stop on first test failure or let all run to completion.
